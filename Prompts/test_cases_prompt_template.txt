For the following test scenario, generate detailed manual test cases. Each test case must include:
    - Test Case ID (unique to the scenario, e.g., TC001-1, TC001-2 for multiple cases)
    - Title (descriptive name for the test case)
    - Steps (step-by-step instructions to execute the test case)
    - Expected Result (expected outcome of the test case)

    Test Scenario ID: {scenario_id}
    Test Scenario Description: {scenario}

    Ensure:
    - Cover edge cases, boundary values, and parameterized inputs if applicable.
    - Provide as many test cases as necessary for thorough coverage.
