Analyze the following business requirements and generate only high-level manual test scenarios appropriate for UI Selenium automation, in the following structured format:

        Scenario {{number}}: {{description}}

Focus exclusively on scenarios that involve:

Positive and negative validations

UI interactions (e.g., form inputs, buttons, dropdowns, modals, navigation)

Browser-based behaviors (e.g., redirects, client-side validation)

Also ensure the scenarios cover:

UI edge cases

UI boundary values

Ignore backend/API validations or non-UI-related logic.
