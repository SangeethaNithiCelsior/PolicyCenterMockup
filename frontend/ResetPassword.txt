Description
This use case describes the process a user follows to reset their password using the Reset Password Page. The page captures and validates the new password and redirects the user to the login page upon successful reset.
________________________________________
Preconditions
•	The user must have successfully passed identity verification (e.g., through a password reset link from email).
•	The user must be routed to the ResetPasswordPage component.
________________________________________
Postconditions
•	The password is considered reset (display message on screen).
•	The user is redirected to the login page (/login).
________________________________________
Basic Flow (Main Success Scenario)
1.	The user navigates to the Reset Password page.
2.	The user enters a new password in the "New Password" field.
3.	The user enters the same password in the "Confirm Password" field.
4.	The user clicks the "Reset Password" button.
5.	The system validates the inputs:
o	If both passwords match:
	Display message on screen "Password reset successful!"
	Redirect user to the login page.
o	If passwords do not match:
	Display message on screen: "Passwords do not match!"

Alternate Flow
•	AF-1: Cancel Reset
1.	The user clicks the "Cancel" button.
2.	The system navigates the user back to the login page.
________________________________________

Assumptions
